# Shielded Vault - Private Yield Farming

> **"As a whale, I can earn yield on $10M USDC without hackers or competitors tracking my wallet address."**

## Overview

**Shielded Vault** allows you to deposit assets into yield-generating strategies while keeping your position size and earnings completely hidden.

### What It Solves

- **Wealth Signaling:** Large deposits attract hackers and scammers.
- **Strategy Leakage:** Competitors monitor whale wallets to copy or counter-trade their positions.
- **Financial Privacy:** You shouldn't have to reveal your entire bank balance just to earn interest.

### How Shielded Vault Protects You

- ✅ **Private Deposits:** No one knows how much you entered with.
- ✅ **Hidden Accrual:** Yield grows "in the dark" — invisible on-chain.
- ✅ **Anonymous Exit:** Withdraw principal and yield to a fresh address without linking it to the deposit.

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Deposit:** Tokens enter privacy pool and become invisible
2. **Earn:** Yield accrues to your hidden position
3. **Claim:** Harvest earnings as new private tokens (optional)
4. **Withdraw:** Exit with principal + yield anytime

## Vault Position Structure

Each vault position is represented by a cryptographic commitment:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           SHIELDED VAULT POSITION               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
